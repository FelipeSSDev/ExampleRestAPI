# Example Rest API
  Example of a RESTful API based on an old [rocketseat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN_8bCfVp88) but updated to current JS standards
  Fixed deprecated methods and updated it to use a remote MongoDB server, as well as making usage of imports

## Running it
  the .example files can be replaced by actual JSON files with the fields inside it being filled
  create a .env file with DB_USER DB_PASSWORD DB_CLUSTER_NAME DB_NAME if you want to keep the same settings as I do for the DB connection
